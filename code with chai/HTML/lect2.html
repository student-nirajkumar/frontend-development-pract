    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
        <b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the standard language used to create and design web pages.<br> 
        It structures content on the web using elements like <u>headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms</u>. 
        HTML uses tags to define different parts of a web page, such as for headings, for paragraphs, and for images. <br>
        It forms the backbone of all websites, working alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and styled content. 
        HTML is essential for web development and is supported by all modern browsers.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>HTML documents are made up of nested elements, <br>and the content is usually divided into the head and body sections. The head contains meta-information like the title, character encoding, and links to external resources such as stylesheets and scripts. The body contains the visible content of the webpage, which users interact with.</p>
